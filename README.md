> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Personal Sync Fork Notice**
>
> This repository is a **personal fork of Baileys** that stays **fully synchronized with the upstream `master` branch**
> from the original WhiskeySockets/Baileys project.
>
> The only intentional deviation is a **simplified WebSocket layer using Bun**,
> intended to streamline local usage and experimentation.
>
> **Scope of this fork:**
> - Continuously synced with upstream `master` commits  
> - No major feature divergence from the original project  
> - Uses **Bun WebSocket** for simpler runtime integration  
> - Intended **strictly for personal use and private experimentation**
>
> All core behavior, protocol handling, and documentation logic from Baileys
> remain aligned with the upstream project.

---

> [!CAUTION]
> **NOTICE OF BREAKING CHANGES (Upstream)**
>
> As of Baileys **v7.0.0**, multiple breaking changes were introduced upstream.
>  
> Please refer to the official migration guide:
> https://whiskey.so/migrate-latest
>
> This fork **directly follows upstream changes** and does not attempt to
> preserve backward compatibility beyond what upstream provides.
